# Shrimp_Segmentation-Counting
Developed an end-to-end instance segmentation pipeline using YOLOv8 to detect and count shrimps in images. Merged LabelMe annotations into unified masks, converted to COCO and YOLO formats, and fine-tuned YOLOv8n-seg. Outputs include annotated images, shrimp counts in CSV, and trained model weights.
